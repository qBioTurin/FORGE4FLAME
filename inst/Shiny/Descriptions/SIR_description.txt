The SIR model is a fundamental compartmental model used to study the dynamics of infectious diseases. It comprises three key compartments:

Susceptible (S): Represents the individuals who are susceptible to the disease. When a susceptible person comes into contact with infected individuals or share a closed space with infected individuals, he/she can contract the disease and move to the infected compartment.

Infected (I): Signifies the individuals who are infected and have the potential to transmit the disease to susceptible individuals.

Recovered (R): Encompasses individuals who have recovered from the infection and gained immunity.

In summary, the SIR model provides a simplified framework for analyzing how infectious diseases spread through a population, considering the interplay between susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals.
