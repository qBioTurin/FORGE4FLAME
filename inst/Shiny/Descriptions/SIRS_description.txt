The SIRS model is an extension of the SIR model, it inlcudes three compartments:
Susceptible (S): Represents the individuals who are susceptible to the disease. When a susceptible person comes into contact with an infected individual, he/she can contract the disease and move to the infected compartment.

Infected (I): Signifies the individuals who are infected and have the potential to transmit the disease to susceptible individuals.

Resistant (R): Encompasses individuals who have recovered from the infection and gained immunity.

The difference between SIRS and SIR is that individuals in the SIRS model lose their immunity after a certain period of time, and become susceptible again.
